## Introduction
 Traveling is a large growing business across all countries. Bus reservation system deals with maintenance of records of details of each passenger. It also includes maintenance of information like schedule and details of each bus.We observed the working of the Bus reservation system and after going through it, we get to know that there are many operations, which they have to do manually. It takes a lot of time and causing many errors while data entry. Due to this, sometimes a lot of problems occur and they were facing many disputes with customers. To solve the above problem, and further maintaining records of passenger details, seat availability, price per seat, bill generation and other things, we are offering this proposal of computerized reservation system.By using this software, we can reserve tickets from any part of the world, through telephone lines, via internet. Customer can check availability of bus and reserve selective seats. The project provides and checks all sorts of constraints so that user does give only useful data and thus validation is done in an effective way.This system is based on a concept to reserve bus tickets. From this system, the user can view bus list, book tickets, cancel bookings and check bus status board.While booking tickets, the user has to enter bus number then the system displays total bus seat numbers with passengers name and the user has to enter the number of tickets, seat number, and name of the person. Here, cancel booking also features refunding. Login system is also available in this system to make it more secure. There’s no chance of data misuse or loss & it’s not time-consuming. The whole project is developed in ‘C’ Programming language, different variables and strings have been used for the development of this project. It’s easy to operate and understand by users.
1.Proper login system

## Research
The focus of the project is to computerize traveling company to manage data, so that all the transactions become fast and there should not be any error in transaction like calculation mistake, bill generation and other things. It replaces all the paper work. It keeps records of all bills also, giving to ensure 100% successful implementation of the computerized Bus reservation system.This reservation system has three modules. First module helps the customer to enquire the availability of seats in a particular bus at particular date. Second module helps him to reserve a ticket. Using third module he can cancel a reserved ticket.
First module retrieves data from tables required for enquire.
Second module inserts values into the tables on reservation.
Third module deletes values into from the table on cancellation of tickets.
## SWOT ANALYSIS
*Customers who make a decision to book a tour or rental don’t want to wait until you are in the office — they want to lock in the activity on their own schedule. 
*Customers who book their own reservations are more likely to show up, making no-shows a thing of the past. 
*With an online booking system, you can require customers to prepay for activities and rentals.
~If you run tours and activities in remote areas where you aren’t able to get on the Internet, online booking might not be for you. You’ll need reliable Internet access to check your reservations and to add bookings that are made online.
~Online booking software is a great way to attract new customers, many of whom prefer booking online from their computers and mobile devices.
